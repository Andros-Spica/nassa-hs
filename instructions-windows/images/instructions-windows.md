In Windows, you may find that Windows Defender acuses a Virus threat and places the file in quarantine. This is independent on the Internet browser you are using. Make sure you do not discard the file.

To access the file, you will need to make a security exception directly in Windows Defender. For Windows 10, go to the search field in the task bar and search for the "Windows Security" app and open it.
